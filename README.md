## About

This is just a simple implementation of a swipeable carousel for mobile browsers using ReactJS.

## Description

I am using [Touch Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#touch-events). The whole project
is based on [this post](http://www.hartzis.me/test-touch-events-react/) by [hartzis](https://github.com/hartzis).

## Function

### Swipe

## Usage

Just copy and paste or get inspired.

## Demo

You can view a live demo [here](https://mandarini.github.io/swipe-carousel/).
Make sure to open it with a mobile device, or inspect it with responsive mode on with Chrome Dev tools or
another interface that emulates swipe events.

## Credits

* Thanks to [hartzis](https://github.com/hartzis) for the inspiration and code.
